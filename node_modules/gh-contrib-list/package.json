Each contributor has the following properties:\n\n- `id` - Github username of the contributor\n- `name` - Full name of the contributor\n- `commitCount` - Number of commits the person has contributed\n\n### Options\n\n- `user` - The user or organization (**required**)\n- `repo` - The repository name (**required**)\n- `commit` - A commit SHA to run the query from (commits including and after this one will be used) (**required**)\n- `oauthKey` - If one is provided it will be used when making Github API requests\n- `to` - If another commit SHA is provided here the commits used will be between the `commit` option and this one.\n- `removeGreenkeeper` - If this is set to true, any commits by Greenkeeper will be automatically removed.\n- `retry` - If this is set to true, the request will be retried in the event that the Github API returns a 202 status (retry momentarily).\n\n---\n\n## Credit:\n\nThis script is heavily based on [top-gh-contribs](https://github.com/novaugust/top-gh-contribs).\n",
